        The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system
        memory. A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer
        can run.

        C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
        reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted
        to multiple platforms.
